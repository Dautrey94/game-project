Cube Jumper

The inspiration from this game comes from Jetpack Joyride and Flappy Birds, two games that I used to play when I was younger. The look is totally different, but the mechanics of the main character are similar.

The objective of the game is to dodge the incoming cubes. 
To jump all you have to do is press the spacebar.
